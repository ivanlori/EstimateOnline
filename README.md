# 🚀 EstimateOnline

## My Personal TypeScript Playground

This project is my personal coding gym where I continuously refactor and improve code as my skills evolve over time. It's an online cost estimation tool built with TypeScript that I use to experiment with new patterns, techniques, and best practices.

### 🧪 What Makes This Project Special?

- **Living Code**: This codebase evolves with my skills - I regularly revisit to apply new concepts
- **TypeScript Focus**: Exploration of TypeScript's type system and features
- **Modern Web Development**: Implementation of contemporary frontend architecture
- **Clean Code Journey**: You can trace my progression as a developer through git history
